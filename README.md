# recreating-minesweeper
A project where I recreate the core gameplay loop of Minesweeper, learning 2D grid mechanics in the process.

This project was created using Unity and C#. It includes necessary features such as uncovering / flagging tiles in the grid, a timer, and flooding if multiple tiles next to eachother are empty. 

All the artwork was (re)created myself using Aseprite.
